Sales Data Analysis Description:

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights and key performance indicators (KPIs). The analysis covers total and average sales, revenue trends by month and city, product performance, and customer behavior patterns. Visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs are used to communicate revenue trends and product performance clearly. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

About the Dataset:

The dataset includes information on product sales transactions, consisting of the following columns:
- Order ID: Unique identifier for each purchase.
- Product: Name of the product sold.
- Quantity Ordered: Quantity of items purchased in the order.
- Price Each: Price per unit of the product.
- Order Date: Timestamp of the order.
- Purchase Address: Shipping address for the order.

Additional columns like Month, Sales, City, and Hour are derived from the above fields to support deeper analysis.
